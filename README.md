Using a combination of React (front-end) and Express (back-end) to handle payments. This approach is often referred to as "server-side payment processing" because we're using a server (Express app) to communicate with Stripe and handle the payment logic. We're not using Firebase Cloud Functions for this specific payment processing, but you're still using a server to interact with Stripe, which is a common approach in e-commerce applications.
