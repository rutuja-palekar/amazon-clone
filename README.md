## What I learned:  ##  
During the development of the Amazon Clone, I gained valuable insights into key aspects of web development, particularly in payment processing and data management. Here's a summary of my learnings:   
  
**Server-Side Payment Processing:**  
- Explored the integration of React for the front-end and Express for the back-end to facilitate payments.  
- Adopted the widely recognized concept of "server-side payment processing" by using the Express server to communicate with Stripe, ensuring secure and efficient payment transactions.   
  
**Firebase Data Handling:**  
- Developed proficiency in storing and retrieving data using Firebase.  
- Accomplished strategic implementation of Firebase without resorting to Firebase Cloud Functions for payment processing.   
  
These challenges have not only improved my technical skills but also given me a deeper understanding of how payment processing, and data management work together to create a secure and user-friendly web app.   
  
  
## Challenges and Solutions: ##
